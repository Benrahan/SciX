# SciX Genies

This is a Github repository for the UNSW SciX program 'Exploring the human genome' for learning Bioinformatics.

This tutorial will follow these steps:

1. Install R and Rstudio
2. Download the files from this github repository
3. Open the SciX.Genies.Rmd file in RStudio
4. Perfrom the analysis by following the instructions

# Overview
The central dogma of biology states that DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is tranlated into protein. RNA sequencing allows scientists to infer the proteins being produced within the tissues of an individual. By comparing the expression levels of RNA between individuals with disease and healthy controls we can identify potential causes of disease or targets for drug therapies. 

In this study, we have processed raw RNA sequencing data from the brains of people with neurodegenerative disease and healthy controls. These studies include:

# Parkinson's disease
Link to data: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE106608 \
Number of patients: 14 \
Number of controls: 18

# Alzheimer's disease
Link to data: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE159699 \
Number of patients: 12 \
Number of controls: Old:10 Young:8 

# Huntingtons disease
Link to data: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE129473 \
Number of patients: 8 \
Number of controls: 5 

# Install R and Rstudio
We will be using the R programming language and the Rstudio IDE for this analysis.

To install R please follow this link to download and install the correct version for your Mac, Windows or Linux computer.

# Download files from github
At the top of this page is be a green button **CODE**. Click the button and then select **Download ZIP**.
This will download a SciX-main.zip file to your Downloads folder on your computer. This file contains everything you will need to perform this study. 
Unzip the file by double clicking and move the unzipped directory to your Desktop.

# Open the SciX.Genies.Rmd in RStudio 
Double click on the SciX.Genies.Rmd file to open in RStudio. Carefully follow the instructions.\
Enjoy and good luck!
